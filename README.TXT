I've implimented a Pad and also included the ability to print the encrypted code in blocks of 5; I'm going for exceeds expectation (It said to mention this in instructions)

I've prepared a file called RUNME.py to easily allow you to test my software's encryption and decryption functionality.
I believe the RUNME.py allows you to test my code more easily than implementer.py, but implementer.py allows essentially the same thing.

Working ciphers include:
-Caesar
-Atbash
-Transposition
-Keyword

Thanks for taking the time to grade this!
